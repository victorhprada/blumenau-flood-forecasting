    """Get data set instance, depending on the run configuration.

    Currently implemented datasets are 'multimet',
    as well as the 'generic' dataset class that can be used for any kind of dataset as long as it is
    in the correct format.

    New dataset classes can be added at the beginning of runtime using the function register_dataset().

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : Config
        The run configuration.
    is_train : bool
        Defines if the dataset is used for training or evaluating. If True (training), means/stds for each feature
        are computed and stored to the run directory. If one-hot encoding is used, the mapping for the one-hot encoding
        is created and also stored to disk. If False, the scaler must be calculated (`compute_scaler` must be True).
    period : {'train', 'validation', 'test'}
        Defines the period for which the data will be loaded
    basin : list[str], optional
        If passed, the data for only these basins will be loaded. Otherwise the basin(s) is(are) read from the appropriate
        basin file, corresponding to the `period`.
    compute_scaler : bool
        Forces the dataset to calculate a new scaler instead of loading a precalculated scaler. Used during training, but
        not finetuning.

    Returns
    -------
    Dataset
        A new data set instance, depending on the run configuration.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If no data set class is implemented for the 'dataset' argument in the config.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key : str
        The key of the dataset that is set in the configuration file.

    new_class : Type
        The new Dataset class to register.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the new class is not derived from Dataset.
